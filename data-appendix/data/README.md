### Data files

- `listings.csv/dta` stores all listings observed in my sample and their relevant characteristics, where each row corresponds to a listing.
- `bids.csv/dta` stores all bids observed, where each row corresponds to a bid.
- `demeaned.csv/dta` stores the same information as `bids.csv/dta` but with homogenised bids.
- `simulated.csv` stores both original bids of non-police auctions and simulated bids of police auctions.
